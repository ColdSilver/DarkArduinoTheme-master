# DarkArduinoTheme-master

Sometimes the commonly used term of black and white meaning "Clearly more to the eye"
But in fact this is not really the most obvious combination ..

I thought maybe it's time to really give to the Arduino IDE a little color to the cheeks.

What does that mean?!

It means changing the color settings for all functions that comes in default settings with the white theme software that it's all
familiar to us, but it also can be changed for anyone who looking for legible writing.

I found that the most appropriate color combination is the "Monokai Sublime 2" series.

The bottom line is, I made this color changes on the screen so beautiful you'll want to lick them..

I have not deleted anything that existed in the original file, the original files extension is named "Original".

All you have to do is extract the zip file called "lib" that I attached to you and drop it instead of the original one that existing in
your computer drive: C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Arduino \ ___

It is important for me to note: This theme Supporting at The current version of the arduino (1.6.9), didn't checked on the earlier ones..

Now, Sometimes when you reinvent, you make mistakes. I think the correct way is to admit them quickly, and keep improving other
innovations, so I'd love to hear from you comments, insights etc..

Good luck with your projects !
